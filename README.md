# README: Collaboration Guide

## Welcome to the Project
This project is an open academic initiative dedicated to exploring differential ontology. If you are a scholar interested in ontology, philosophy, or interdisciplinary research and wish to collaborate, this document will guide you through the process.

### Who is This For?
This README is designed for academics who may not be comfortable with technology but want to contribute meaningfully to the project.

## What is a Do-ocracy?
This project follows a **do-ocracy** model. This means that those who take initiative and actively contribute shape the direction of the project. Rather than waiting for permission, participants engage with the project by doing. 

A do-ocracy values action over hierarchy—if you see something that needs doing and can contribute, you are encouraged to do so. More on this principle can be found here: [Do-ocracy](https://communitywiki.org/wiki/DoOcracy).
